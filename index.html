        <h1>Hello, world</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome to "my" github-hosted page.</p>
        <p>I'll be updating this soon I guess, but I make no promises on that.</p>
        <h2>Overall experience</h2>
        <p>This github profile is new, but me, computers and coding are pals for
        over 2 decades already.</p>
        <p>I played with lots of software, a bunch of programming languages in
        the past.</p>
        <p>Below there is a couple of lists to get you going with what I have
        learnt over these 2 decades. It might not be much, but, in my defense,
        all these are accumulated during personal spare time.</p>

        <p>Some of the above were made for the learning experience or as good
        challenges. Some (eg ReactJS projects) purely because I was asked to do
        so.</p>
